# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.
# Tech/framework used
* OpenCV
* Caffe-based face detector
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* MobileNetV2
# Features
This face mask detector didn't uses any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google-Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

# Dataset
This dataset consists of 3835 images belonging to two classes:

* with_mask: 1916 images
* without_mask: 1919 images

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

Bing Search API (See Python script)
Kaggle datasets
RMFD dataset (See here)
